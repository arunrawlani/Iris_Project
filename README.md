# Iris
##Won Apple WWDC 2016 Scholarship for the IRIS iOS application.
###IRIS is a news aggreator app that streamlines the way people view news articles. It is equipped with a Map View, where articles are mapped onto regions of origin, and a robust search engine using the Levenshtein distance algorithm.

####What is IRIS and how does it work?
IRISâ€™s focus was to streamline the way news articles are seen and read by university students. We felt that in this age of information overload, students were open to wide range of articles that hampered them from finding out about their own areas of interest.

With IRIS, we allowed students to filter out articles, according to their areas of interest, using our powerful interactive map and our robust search engine that used algorithms such as the Levenshtein string distance and the RAKE. 

We also allowed users to have a quick summary of each article using the summarization algorithm we created using the NLTK platform for Python. The summarization algorithm leveraged the power of the NLTK platform by using their library functions and provided a ten-lines-long summary for articles of varied lengths. This would allow users to skim through the article content before deciding to read it.
